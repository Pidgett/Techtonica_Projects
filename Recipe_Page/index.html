        <p>When I first made this recipe I used pumpkin. I doubled up on the recipe, <em>entirely</em> unprepared for 
        how much quiche I was about to prepare, and ended up with extra dough at the end. I didn't want to waste 
        anything, but was out of pumpkin at home and I began tweaking the recipe beginning with substituting 
        butternut squash for pumpkin, and, in later iterations, eventually adding several herbs to the dough and 
        clarifying the butter before adding it to my flour mixture for the dough. After finding several other recipes
        for quiche crusts, I learned that baking your pie crust before adding the filling helps prevent the crust from 
        becoming soggy before baking. I hope you enjoy this recipe and make it your own!

            <ol>
             <li>Preheat oven to 350â„‰.
                <li>Remove seeds from cardamom pods and use a mortar and pestle to grind them with your tarragon leaves. Set aside.
                <li>Mix flour, butter, and salt with a food processor until fine crumbles form. Mix in spices well.
                <li>Add water to dough and knead well until you have a uniform ball of dough.
                <li>Wrap dough in cellophane and refridgerate for at least one hour(this allows the butter to re-crystalize for your pie crust).
                </ol><br>

        <div id = "recipe2">
            <ol>
                 <li>Chop butternut squash into large chunks and boil with garam masala powder until soft. Remove skin with a large spoon or paring knife and place in a large mixing bowl.
                 <li>Saute spinach with salt and pepper to taste and add to mixing bowl.
                 <li>Caramelize onions and pecans with the onion and brown sugar on your stovetop at just below medium heat, stirring semi-frequently to avoid burning. Place in a separate bowl and set aside.
                 <li>Whisk eggs and add to squash and spinach in your mixing bowl. Mix in feta cheese crumbles with a spoon.
                 <li>Cover and set aside.
                 <li>Remove dough from refridgerator and press into pie tin (or cupcake cups!) and bake without filling for 10-12 minutes.
                 <li>Add filling and garnish with caramelized onions and pecans.
                 <li>Bake for another 20 minutes. Allow quiche to cool 15 minutes before enjoying!
